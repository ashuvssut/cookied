## The Origin Story of Cookied üç™

Today we all rely on popular browsers equipped with built-in bookmark managers. Sure, they come with mobile apps to sync our bookmarks seamlessly across devices, but there's a catch. These built-in managers offer a rather limited set of features, often leaving us craving for a richer user experience. 

**But hold on!** While the built-in browser bookmarks manager might efficiently sync your bookmarks within the confines of a particular browser brand, it falls short when you want to sync across different browser brands.

Now, you might argue that there are alternative feature-packed bookmark managers as Chrome extensions in the Web Store. But here's the kicker - are they truly cross-platform? Can you seamlessly use those Chrome extensions with your smartphone browsers? Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding NO.

Enter Cookied! üåê A cross-platform browser bookmarks manager designed to empower you to effortlessly manage and sync your bookmarks, regardless of the device or browser brand you prefer. 

And that's not all! *Cookied goes beyond the ordinary* with features like **fuzzy search**, enabling you to find your bookmarks effortlessly. Ever tried describing your ancient-long-forgotten bookmarks in words to an **AI Vector Search**? With Cookied, now you can!

But wait, there's more to come! üöÄ We're actively working on a list of upcoming features to make your browsing experience even more delightful. Check out the exciting ideas in our [TODO.md](./TODO.md) file! Stay tuned for more Cookied goodness. üç™‚ú®
